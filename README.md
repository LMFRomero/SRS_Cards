# projJap

Project do exercise new concepts of C++
that I'm learning. Despite of that, it
will be useful for my japanese studies.
Although it will receive minor updates
as I get to learn more OOP concepts, it
will not receive major updates and changes
to its code structure.

This program is intended to use Spaced Repetition System and flashcards
to practice the japanese language: its vocabulary and phrases given from
the user, and, of course, its two basic phonetic alphabets, kana.
